PopSift Library
=============

PopSift is an open-source implementation of the SIFT algorithm in CUDA :cite:`Griwodz2018Popsift`.
PopSift tries to stick as closely as possible to David Lowe's famous paper :cite:`Lowe2003`, while extracting features from an image in real-time at least on an NVidia GTX 980 Ti GPU.
