# Config file for PopSift.
#
# This file is used by CMake when find_package(PopSift) is invoked and either
# the directory containing this file either is present in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
# (if PopSift was installed), or exists in the local CMake package registry if
# the PopSift build directory was exported.
#
# This module defines a namespace PopSift:: and the target needed to compile and
# link against the library. The target automatically propagate the dependencies
# of the library.
#
# In your CMakeLists.txt  file just add the dependency
#
# find_package(PopSift CONFIG REQUIRED)
#
# Then if you want to link it to an executable
#
# add_executable(poptest yourfile.cpp)
#
# Then to the library
#
# target_link_libraries(poptest PUBLIC PopSift::popsift)
#
# Note that target_include_directories() is not necessary.
